# **⋆🐾° ┊ Description** 📃
#### MeowsterQuest is a turn-based RPG loop of exploration, combat, and rewards to keep gameplay engaging. It solves the problem of repetitive RPGs by combining strategic battles with a clear progression, letting players rescue captured citizens and restore peace to Pawshire.

#### It demonstrates the practical use of Object-oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, alongside proper file handling and modular design.


### WHAT CAN YOU DO?

### Player can:

- Choose Cat Breed
- Customized it by color
- Pick special moves
- Gain Hp and Points
- Win the Battle(eme)

## **How to Run the Game**
<p align="center">
  <img src="resources/Qmark.gif" alt=" ??? " width="1000" height="200">
</p>

**1. Navigate to the project root**
- #### Open your terminal and go to the root directory of your project (where the `src` folder or packages like `core`, `combat`, etc. are located).
```
cd path/to/MEOWSTERQUEST
```
**2. Compile the Java files**
#### Assuming your source files are inside a `src` folder and follow a package structure (`core`, `combat`, etc.), compile all `.java` files:

```
javac -d bin src\core\Main.java
```
**3. Run the main class** 

#### Your entry point is `core.Main`, so run it using:
```
java core.Main
```
#### Make sure the project is compiled. Then, run the program by pointing Java to the folder with compiled `.class` files:
```
java -cp bin core.Main
```

### **What can YOU do (Features)**
1. **Add info.** Enter the name of your character
#### `Enter your cat's name:`
2. **Select Character.** Can choose the breed and color of the cat by selecting the designated number.

#### `=== Choose Your Cat Breed (Class) ===`

3. **Battle Actions.** Player can Attack, Defend, Trigger Special Actions, Regenerate Energy, and Level Up.

4. **Tower Progression.** Fights through a three(3) level tower, Rescue prisoners, Retry battles if defeated, and Interacts with NPC.

5. **Immersion.** Enjoy the ASCII art graphics and the charactersirics of each Heroes through the **Colors**, and Experience **Typewriter-style dialouge.**



# **⋆🐾° ┊ Object-Oriented Principles**

## 🌌 Abstraction
#### Abstraction is used heavily in classes like TextUtil and MusicUtil, where complex logic for typewriter effects, delays, and sound playback is hidden behind simple method calls such as typewriterPrintCentered or playSFX. This keeps Tower, BattleSystem, and other systems clean and focused on game logic because they don’t need to know how text rendering or audio handling works internally.

## 💊 Encapsulation
#### Encapsulation appears in classes where important variables like player health, enemy stats, sound file paths, and text settings are kept private and are accessed or modified only through methods. This protects game data from accidental misuse, ensures values stay valid, and keeps all changes controlled inside the class itself, making the code safer and more reliable.

## 🦋 Polymorphism
#### Polymorphism is used when the battle system interacts with enemies through the Enemy type while allowing each enemy subclass to override methods like attack, speak, or special moves. This lets the battle system call the same method on different enemy types but get different behaviors depending on the actual object, which makes combat system flexible and easy to expand with new enemies.

## 🧬 Inheritance
#### Inheritance is used in the overall structure of the combat and entity system. Classes such as Player and Enemy extend a common base entity class and share attributes such as health points, attack lists, and names. This allows shared behavior while still supporting unique features for different entity types. This setup also makes the project ready for expansion, since new types of enemies or special player subclasses can easily inherit from the base class.
